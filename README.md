# Time Series R Arima example. Vizualize with Excel - Tableau.
This repository contains a simple time forecast series example.

The example will load champagne sales data from a excel spread sheet;
forecast via ARIMA future sales and then export the data back to an excel
workbook.

Main Take away. You CAN use R and Tableau Public (free version) to 
reproduce plots for time series R data in Tableau by doing most of
the heavy lifting in R and/or Excel.

The point is to show how you can use a low cost / no cost solution
to analyze data and visualize that data in another tool.  Please
see my Tableau example below.
