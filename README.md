# Time Series R Arima example. Vizualize with Excel - Tableau.
This repository contains a simple time series example.
The example will load champagne sales data, forecast via ARIMA
future sales and then export the data back to an excel workbook.

The point is to show how you can use a low cost / no cost solution
to analyze data and visualize that data in another tool.  Please
see my Tableau example below.
